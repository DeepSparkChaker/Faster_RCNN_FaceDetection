# Faster_RCNN_FaceDetection
Train Faster RCNN using Keras to detect face 
# Training a facial detection model

-Download the Wiki dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLF3xRBjEzMGAW0UXXCuz7zYLvdKw2cx/view?usp=drivesdk)

-Perform EDA and cleaning on the dataset

-Implement Faster-RCNN model using tf.keras

-Setup tensorboard with acc and loss plotting and tensorflow profiler to monitor training performance

-Write a demo script to test the model on webcam
# Notes:

-This application should be divided into seperate modules/scripts 

-Create a repo on github and push changes in the code with clear commit messages every step of the way

-The model implementation shall be done using tf.keras and tensorflow >= 2.0
# CRISP-DM Methodology

In this section we overview our selected method for engineering our solution. CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is an open standard guide that describes common approaches that are used by data mining experts. CRISP-DM includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, including tasks details and provides an overview of the data mining lifecycle. The lifecycle model consists of six phases with arrows indicating the most important and frequent dependencies between phases. The sequence of the phases is not strict. In fact, most projects move back and forth between phases as necessary. It starts with business understanding, and then moves to data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment. The CRISP-DM model is flexible and can be customized easily.

==>Our process to manage our project using the open standard CRISP-DM which will be more detailed in the rest of project phases.
